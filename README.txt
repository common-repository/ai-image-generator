## Next Development Phase: AI Image Editor using Dall E and OpenAI in AI Image Generator Plugin

AI Image Editing Based on Marking and Text Instructions
The user uploads an image and then employs a tool (similar to a brush in Photoshop) to mark the areas where editing is desired. Subsequently, the user enters a description in the text field specifying what they want the artificial intelligence to replace, edit, or add. The AI will then edit the image to fulfill the provided instructions.

The image editing process entails uploading an existing image and formulating requirements in the form of textual descriptions. AI Image Generator will then generate a new image according to the given specifications. For instance, one can upload a landscape image and request the sky to be modified to a clear and sunny appearance. AI Image Generator will subsequently generate a new image with the sky modified as requested. This functionality proves immensely valuable in the advertising field, where the frequent creation of personalized images for marketing campaigns or advertisements is crucial.
